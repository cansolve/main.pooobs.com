# Easily Prone to Long-Distance Relationships in Zi Wei Dou Shu Charts

Based on specific configurations in the Zi Wei Dou Shu chart, certain combinations may indicate a higher likelihood of long-distance relationships. These factors involve the interplay of the Spouse Palace, Career Palace, Sibling Palace, and the influence of stars such as **Di Jie (地劫)** and **Tian Ma (天马)**. Below is an analysis of the key indicators:

---

### **Configurations Prone to Long-Distance Relationships**

#### **1. Spouse Palace with Di Jie or Tian Ma**

- **Analysis**:

  - **Di Jie** represents emptiness or detachment. When present in the Spouse Palace, it suggests that the relationship is easily influenced by external circumstances such as distance or time apart.
  - **Tian Ma** is a star of movement and change, indicating that the spouse may frequently travel or relocate due to work or other commitments.
  - The combination of Di Jie and Tian Ma in the Spouse Palace intensifies the likelihood of separation due to constant changes.

- **Manifestations**:

  - The partner may frequently travel for work or reside in a different city, leading to a situation where time together is limited.
  - Relationships may experience insecurity due to physical separation, although strong communication can help maintain the bond.

#### **2. Hong Luan or Tian Xi with Di Jie Nearby**

- **Analysis**:

  - **Hong Luan** and **Tian Xi** symbolize romance and marriage affinity. If either is paired with **Di Jie**, the romance may face obstacles, such as distance or external interferences, making it harder to sustain.
  - During the relationship or courtship phase, long-distance factors—such as work, study, or family obligations—are often significant challenges.

- **Manifestations**:

  - Relationships often start as online or long-distance relationships. Physical separation can make it harder for the connection to grow.
  - If **Hong Luan** or **Tian Xi** in the annual chart is further affected by **Di Jie**, it may indicate periods of separation or emotional distance in marriage.

#### **3. Career Palace with Di Jie or Tian Ma**

- **Analysis**:

  - The Career Palace represents work and professional development. The presence of **Di Jie** or **Tian Ma** suggests instability or frequent relocations due to work, affecting the ability to maintain a stable relationship.
  - **Di Jie** implies challenges in maintaining consistency in career, while **Tian Ma** indicates frequent movement for career purposes.

- **Manifestations**:

  - The spouse or the individual may be involved in professions requiring constant travel or relocation, such as trade, aviation, or logistics.
  - The relationship may face difficulties as work commitments demand physical separation.

---

#### **4. Sibling Palace with Di Jie**

- **Analysis**:

  - The Sibling Palace, adjacent to the Spouse Palace, indirectly influences the stability of relationships. **Di Jie** in the Sibling Palace often indicates estrangement or a lack of support from family, which can extend to emotional detachment in relationships.
  - This configuration often points to a lifestyle where the individual is away from family, increasing the likelihood of long-distance relationships.

- **Manifestations**:

  - The individual may have left home for study or work at an early age, resulting in a pattern of long-term separation from close ones.
  - If the Spouse Palace or Travel Palace is similarly affected, the probability of long-distance relationships is significantly higher.

#### **5. Female Charts: Di Jie Near the Sun or in its Opposing Palace**

- **Analysis**:

  - In female charts, **Tai Yang (Sun)** represents the husband or significant male figure. If **Di Jie** is near the Sun, it suggests that the husband may lead a life marked by frequent travel or relocation, making it difficult for him to stay by the native's side.
  - If **Di Jie** is in the opposing palace of the Sun, external factors may cause the relationship to endure long-term separation.

- **Manifestations**:

  - The spouse may have a busy career or a profession requiring frequent travel.
  - The relationship requires trust and communication to overcome challenges created by physical distance.

---

#### **6. Male Charts: Di Jie Near the Moon or in its Opposing Palace**

- **Analysis**:

  - In male charts, **Tai Yin (Moon)** represents the wife or significant female figure. When **Di Jie** is near the Moon, it indicates that the wife may frequently travel or reside in a different location, often due to career or family obligations.
  - If **Di Jie** is in the opposing palace, it suggests that the wife’s lifestyle or circumstances make it challenging for the couple to stay together consistently.

- **Manifestations**:

  - The spouse may work in fields that require mobility, such as education, healthcare, or cross-regional businesses.
  - The individual may struggle to maintain the initiative in the relationship, especially when faced with long-distance challenges.
