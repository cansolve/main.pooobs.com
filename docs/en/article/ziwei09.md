# How to Analyze Your Partner’s Infidelity Risk Through the Spouse Palace in Zi Wei Dou Shu

**1. Analyzing the Main Stars in the Spouse Palace**

1. **Seven Killings (Qi Sha), Po Jun, and Tan Lang**

- **Traits**: These stars represent intense personalities, a desire for excitement, and novelty.
- **Emotional Impact**: When present in the Spouse Palace, your partner might act impulsively or become easily tempted by external factors, leading to emotional instability. Be mindful of potential irresponsibility in relationships.

2. **Lian Zhen**

- **Traits**: As a peach blossom star, Lian Zhen can indicate attraction and charm. When paired with Hua Ji or afflicted by inauspicious stars, it signals emotional instability.
- **Emotional Impact**: Partners with Lian Zhen in the Spouse Palace may find it challenging to resist external temptations, especially under unfavorable configurations.

3. **Zi Wei, Tian Fu, and Tian Xiang**

- **Traits**: These stars symbolize rationality, reliability, and a sense of responsibility.
- **Emotional Impact**: Partners with these stars in the Spouse Palace are typically more faithful and committed. However, the presence of Hua Ji or malefic stars can increase the risk of emotional imbalance due to external pressures.

#### **2. The Influence of Four Transformations (Hua Lu, Hua Quan, Hua Ke, Hua Ji)**

1. **Hua Ji in the Spouse Palace**

- **Impact**: Hua Ji introduces conflicts and challenges. Its presence in the Spouse Palace indicates that your partner may face emotional struggles, increasing the risk of infidelity.
- **Advice**: Focus on improving communication and resolving conflicts early to avoid misunderstandings.

2. **Hua Lu and Hua Quan in the Spouse Palace**

- **Impact**: These transformations symbolize stability and responsibility. Their presence in the Spouse Palace suggests a partner who is more inclined to loyalty and commitment.
- **Advice**: Build mutual trust and nurture the relationship for long-term stability.

#### **3. The Role of Related Palaces**

1. **Interaction Between the Life Palace and Spouse Palace**

- The Life Palace reflects your attitude toward relationships, while the Spouse Palace reveals your partner’s behavior. A harmonious interaction indicates a more stable marriage.

2. **Impact of the Travel Palace and Annual Palaces**

- The Travel Palace represents your partner’s external environment. If afflicted by malefic stars or Hua Ji, external temptations may arise.
- The Annual Spouse Palace indicates emotional trends for the year. If it encounters unfavorable stars, be vigilant for potential emotional challenges.

#### **Summary and Suggestions**

1. **High Stability**: Partners with stars like Zi Wei, Tian Fu, or Tian Xiang in the Spouse Palace, or with favorable transformations (Hua Lu, Hua Quan), are generally reliable and committed.
2. **Higher Risk**: Partners with stars like Seven Killings, Po Jun, Tan Lang, or Lian Zhen (when afflicted) may be more susceptible to external temptations and emotional instability.
3. **Key Considerations**: The overall chart should be analyzed comprehensively, considering interactions between the Life Palace, Spouse Palace, and related palaces for a complete picture.
