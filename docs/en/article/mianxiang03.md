# The Spouse Palace

**The Spouse Palace (夫妻宫)** in Purple Star Astrology (Zi Wei Dou Shu) and face reading is one of the twelve key palaces. It is located at the area between the **end of the eyebrows and the temples**, also referred to as the **Jian Men (奸门)**. This palace symbolizes marriage, spousal relationships, emotional harmony, and the overall impact of a partner on one’s life. It offers insight into marital stability, spousal personality, and external influences on a relationship.

Here is a detailed explanation of the Spouse Palace:

**1. Location of the Spouse Palace and How to Observe**

**Location**

• The Spouse Palace lies at the **temples**, extending from the **end of the eyebrows to the hairline**.

• **Left side Spouse Palace**: Reflects your subjective feelings about your spouse and the marriage.

• **Right side Spouse Palace**: Represents your spouse’s attitude towards you and the objective status of your relationship.

**How to Observe the Spouse Palace**

1. **Smooth and Bright**

• Indicates a harmonious marriage and a loving, cooperative relationship with your spouse.

2. **Sunken or Dull**

• Suggests challenges in marriage, possible conflicts, or a spouse with weaker personal luck.

3. **Wrinkles, Spots, or Moles**

• These features can signify disruptions, instability, or external interference in the relationship.

4. **Full and Lustrous**

• Signifies a capable and supportive spouse, with a happy and prosperous marital life.

**2. Characteristics of the Spouse Palace**

**1. Full, Bright, and Smooth**

• A stable and happy marriage with mutual respect and strong compatibility.

• The spouse is likely to be supportive, with good personality traits and possibly strong career capabilities.

• The fuller and smoother the Spouse Palace, the better the partner’s overall quality and contribution to the marriage.

**2. Sunken Spouse Palace**

• Indicates potential challenges in the marriage, such as misunderstandings, emotional detachment, or health concerns of the spouse.

• May also signify misalignment of values between partners, causing friction or unhappiness.

• If the sunken feature is prominent, it could hint at difficulty in maintaining the marriage or the possibility of separation.

**3. Wrinkles in the Spouse Palace**

• **Horizontal lines**: Suggest possible temporary separations or emotional instability.

• **Diagonal lines**: Represent external interferences such as a third party or family disputes.

• **Cross lines**: Indicate significant challenges in the marriage that require attention and effort to resolve.

• **Thin, shallow lines**: Denote minor quarrels or misunderstandings, usually without lasting harm.

**4. Spots or Dullness**

• Can signify fluctuations in the relationship, including financial stress, health issues, or external disruptions.

• Severe dullness may reflect long-standing coldness in the relationship or unresolved conflicts.

**5. Moles in the Spouse Palace**

• **Good Moles**: Small, dark, and shiny moles suggest a supportive and capable spouse and a positive marital life.

• **Problematic Moles**: Greyish, irregularly shaped moles can signify infidelity, emotional instability, or significant obstacles in the marriage.

**3. Relationship Between the Spouse Palace and Marital Luck**

**1. Emotional Stability**

• A smooth, bright, and symmetrical Spouse Palace signifies a stable, loving relationship.

• Uneven or flawed features indicate potential imbalances in emotional investment between partners.

**2. Personality and Health of the Spouse**

• A well-defined Spouse Palace suggests a positive and outgoing partner with good health.

• A sunken or dark Spouse Palace may imply a more reserved spouse or one with potential health issues.

**3. Longevity and Endurance of Marriage**
