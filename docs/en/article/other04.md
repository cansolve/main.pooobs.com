In Zi Wei Dou Shu (Purple Star Astrology), the **Spouse Palace (夫妻宫)** is a vital element for analyzing marriage dynamics and a spouse’s characteristics, including their physical appearance and body type. By interpreting the main and auxiliary stars in the Spouse Palace, along with the interactions between different palaces, it’s possible to infer a partner’s build and overall demeanor.

**Main Stars in the Spouse Palace and Body Type**

1. **Zi Wei (紫微)**: The partner often has an elegant demeanor, a well-proportioned physique, and exudes leadership qualities. Generally, their height is average to tall.

2. **Tian Ji (天机)**: Associated with a lean or slender build, reflecting a flexible and active personality.

3. **Tai Yang (太阳)**: Denotes a robust, tall, and energetic partner with a sunny disposition.

4. **Ju Men (巨门)**: Indicates a strong and defined physique, often accompanied by a loud or commanding voice.

5. **Tian Tong (天同)**: The partner may have a rounder, softer appearance with radiant skin, exuding a gentle charm.

6. **Tian Fu (天府)**: Represents a stable and balanced figure, often leaning toward a fuller or wealthier appearance.

7. **Lian Zhen (廉贞)**: Suggests a solid or muscular frame with an air of charisma or toughness.

8. **Tan Lang (贪狼)**: Implies a dynamic and attractive appearance, with a balanced or slightly alluring physique.

**Interactions with Other Stars**

• **Four Transformations (化禄, 化权, 化科, 化忌)**: These transformations can adjust the general appearance or temperament of the spouse. For example:

• **Hua Lu (化禄)**: Adds a sense of prosperity and a fuller figure.

• **Hua Ji (化忌)**: May result in a thinner or more frail appearance.

• **Auxiliary Stars**:

• **Lu Cun (禄存)**: Suggests a rounded physique and gentle temperament.

• **Hong Luan (红鸾)**: Adds beauty and romantic charm to the spouse.

• **Qing Yang (擎羊) or Tuo Luo (陀罗)**: Might signify a partner with sharp features or a slightly rigid aura.

**Palace Interactions**

• **Opposing Palaces**: The Spouse Palace’s interaction with the **Self Palace (命宫)** or **Travel Palace (迁移宫)** provides additional clues about the spouse’s body type.

• **Tian Liang (天梁)** in the opposing palace may indicate a slender spouse.

• **Wu Qu (武曲)** often corresponds to a sturdy or athletic build.

**Earthly Branch Influence**

The **Earthly Branch** of the Spouse Palace also affects the spouse’s overall physique:

• **Zi (子) or Wu (午)**: Indicates a strong and commanding appearance.

• **Si (巳) or Hai (亥)**: Reflects a more agile and slim figure.

**Conclusion**

The Spouse Palace in Zi Wei Dou Shu provides a fascinating glimpse into a partner’s potential physical traits and overall aura. However, this analysis should be interpreted alongside the entire chart for accurate results. A professional astrologer can provide deeper insights by examining the interplay between all the palaces and stars in the chart.
