The chart is as follows:&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The Zi Wei star is located in the Career (官禄) Palace, indicating that the candidate(Trump) possesses strong leadership qualities and a steady approach to governance. Throughout the election process, this may translate into a mature and confident demeanor. Based on the movement of the Flying Stars, the chart suggests a high likelihood of winning the election, though the victory may not be entirely secure.</p><p>Furthermore, the Wen Qu star transforms into Ji (忌, representing challenges) in the Friends (交友) Palace, which suggests weaknesses in social relations and support networks. This could reflect internal disagreements within the candidate&#39;s camp or insufficient mobilization of external allies. As a result, the election outcome may lack an overwhelming majority, with the race remaining closely contested.</p><p>Considering the overall chart, Trump appears to have a strong chance of coming out ahead, but the influence of swing states warrants close attention. The fluctuations in these regions could prove decisive, especially if the candidate demonstrates adaptability in critical moments.</p><p>In summary, the chart reveals a situation of both opportunities and challenges: while the odds lean toward victory, the path to success is unlikely to be smooth.</p><p><span style="color:white;user-select:none;">Donald Trump / Kamala Harris / prediction / results/ election/ prediction/ poll/ vote/ white house/ president/ usa/Donald Trump / Kamala Harris / prediction / results/ election/ prediction/ poll/ vote/ white house/ president/ usa/Donald Trump / Kamala Harris / prediction / results/ election/ prediction/ poll/ vote/ white house/ president/ usa/Donald Trump / Kamala Harris / prediction / results/ election/ prediction/ poll/ vote/ white house/ president/ usa/Donald Trump / Kamala Harris / prediction / results/ election/ prediction/ poll/ vote/ white house/ president/ usa/Donald Trump / Kamala Harris / prediction / results/ election/ prediction/ poll/ vote/ white house/ president/ usa/Donald Trump / Kamala Harris / prediction / results/ election/ prediction/ poll/ vote/ white house/ president/ usa/Donald Trump / Kamala Harris / prediction / results/ election/ prediction/ poll/ vote/ white house/ president/ usa/Donald Trump / Kamala Harris / prediction / results/ election/ prediction/ poll/ vote/ white house/ president/ usa/Donald Trump / Kamala Harris / prediction / results/ election/ prediction/ poll/ vote/ white house/ president/ usa/</span></p>',9)]))}const y=t(n,[["render",l]]);export{f as __pageData,y as default};
